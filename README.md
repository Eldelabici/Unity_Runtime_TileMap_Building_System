# Unity-TileMap-Build-System

Personal project.  
It's a basic system that allows the player to build with tiles on a tilemap using only clicks.

## Main features
- Preview of selected tiles  
- Multi-selection of tiles  
- Mouse-based input  

Under development.

## Quick setup
The setup is very straightforward:  
just add the **`TMBS_InGameTileMapBuilding`** component to a GameObject with a TileMap component and t he father of such GameObject should have a Grid, assign the required references (Tilemap, Grid, Input Actions), and you're ready to start building.
